# Off Course!

A botched team submission for [GMTK 2025](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2025) under the theme "Loop", made using [Godot](https://godotengine.org). This project has its own [itch.io](https://avaxar.itch.io/off-course) page.

## Description

Loop around gravitational orbs as Lupin, a guinea pig in a zero-gravity testing chamber, and sling-shot your way through places, as you garner momentum from it, while two bored researchers aboard give random commentary over your crossincarnational endeavor.

## Controls

Just use either your **Space** bar, **Left Mouse Button**, or **tap** on your mobile devices. Hold to latch onto the gravitational orbs; release to stray away from its influence.

If you get stuck, press the **LOOP** button to kill your current guinea pig and reset. (Is it worth it?)
